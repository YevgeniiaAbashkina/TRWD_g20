            text:"In the lesson, students will learn more about America’s longest war — its causes and its consequences. Then, they will consider arguments for and against removing U.S. forces and debate: Should we have withdrawn from Afghanistan? On Aug. 30, the United States removed all military forces from Afghanistan — ending America’s longest war nearly 20 years after it began. The war claimed 170,000 lives and cost over $2 trillion. Now, the Taliban is in control of the country, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001, the day of the terrorist attacks on the United States by Al Qaeda. In the lesson, you will learn more about the causes and the consequences of the United States’ war in Afghanistan. In a Going Further activity, you will explore first-person stories from Afghanistan and consider whether the U.S. should have withdrawn.",
